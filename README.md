# Simple Test

## Base Setup

I believe selecting the right tools for the job is important, and since this test is fairly simple, I used a minimal set of tools for the site.  I included HTML5 boiler plate as a starting point, and then hand coded everything else. I choose not in include a buid system or grid framework as I felt this would overcomplicate the task at hand.

### Note
Be sure to set this project up as a website, and don't just run it off the file system to avoid errors when loading in the json.
